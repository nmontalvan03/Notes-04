# Cybersecurity

It is responsible for protecting networks, devices and access data that are not authorized for certain criminal use.
where they want to use your information for other things, which security focuses on guaranteeing confidentiality and
integrity of the information that is stored in the cloud since all this depends on devices such as computers and a 
good internet because now communication can be by email, smartphone,tablets among others, cybersecurity is also 
based on entertainment such as video games, social networks,applications, transportation among many lists that depend on technology.

Cybersecurity has its risks, however one of these may be having little security in your information making it 
easier for you to be attacked by malware that causes everything to be deleted from your system, you are also
prone to cyberattack where the attacker enters your system by injecting a virus to better facilitate your the 
task to acquire any information that will be helpful, such as the credit cards where they can make purchases
that you have not authorized. However, it is not guaranteed that you have your precautions to Having better 
security when backing up your information in the cloud, there is always a small chance that they will acquire
your information no matter how much security you put in place.


# What can you do to improve your cybersecurity?

One of the first steps you should take is to recognize the risk that can lead to you not being protected.
your information :

Hacker, attacker or intruder tries to find the weaknesses of the software to create a virus
in order to steal or alter the information.

Malicious code, also known as malware, is based on unwanted programs or files that help cause harm.
to the device to compromise the data that is stored on the computer since malicious codes
include viruses, worms and trojan horse in which it makes the computer system go crazy which
It is even almost impossible to recover the computer system these viruses enter because they open files
not intended in which it contains malware in order to make it easier for them to infect your computer and thus acquire all
the information they wish to possess.

Vulnerabilities: they are found in the software, firmware or hardware, this is where the attacker takes advantage to gain entry
to the device and begin to perform actions that are not authorized, thus successfully infecting the
computer with malware.


# Minimize the risks of cyberattacks, follow basic cybersecurity best practices:

- Keep software up to date.
- Run up-to-date antivirus software.
- Use strong passwords.
- Change default usernames and passwords.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Install a firewall.
- Be suspicious of unexpected emails.

In cybersecurity, I found it interesting how the AWS Identity and Access Management security process was explained.
how this web service will help you control and securely maintain the information in which it details what
resource can be used and in what way. We also have AWS Services for Cloud Security, this explains how to maintain
security in your accounts since you have to be careful when protecting your data, however this will help you have
stronger security since AWS cloud Security is responsible for helping organizations develop and evolve
security giving you the confidence to provide you with the necessary steps to ensure that your information is secure.

In this module I learned what steps I should follow so that my devices are not vulnerable to being attacked by
a malware and that my information runs the risk of being hacked in which they give you tips so that your information is
secure, also in how to use AWS services, which benefits you since it provides you with the information
necessary so that your data is safe and not prone to suffering a cyber attack.

How safe is it to use AWS Services And what is the probability of having a cyber attack?
